# Loan Default Prediction â€“ Machine Learning Project

Final Project: Credit Risk Analysis & Default Prediction using Python
Author: Your Name
Module: Machine Learning / Data Science
Class: 4th year â€“ Computer Science (AI/ML/Data Science)

 # Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer loan data and building a machine learning model to predict whether a borrower will default on their loan.

It includes 3 main parts:

 Data Analysis & Preprocessing

 Exploratory Data Visualization

 Machine Learning Models for Loan Default Classification

Dataset contains information about customer demographics, income, loan history, credit behavior and repayment status.

# 2. Objectives

ðŸ’³ Understand factors that affect loan repayment.

ðŸ“‰ Analyze trends between income, loan amount, credit score and default rate.

ðŸ¤– Build predictive models to classify customers as:

0 â€“ Non-default (Good borrower)

1 â€“ Default risk (High-risk borrower)

ðŸ“Š Evaluate models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.
